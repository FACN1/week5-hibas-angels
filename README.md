# week5-hibas-angels
A very warm welcome to the repository for Hiba's Angels' week 5 project, a stack overflow questions news feed.

- The news feed should refresh automatically

git clone https://github.com/FACN1/week5-hibas-angels.git

npm install
npm start
```

## Local Test Instructions
```bash

```

## User Stories
As a **user looking for stackoverflow questions**
> I want to navigate to your website

> So that I can see a list of the most recently-asked questions

As a **user looking for questions on a specific topic**
> I want to be able to select a topic on the page

> So that I can get a list of questions on that topic alone

As a **user whose focus flits regularly between different tasks**
> I want to be able to look back at the screen after a period of distraction and still see the most recent posts instead of outdated ones

> So that I can rest assured that I am staying abreast of the latest questions which have been posted

## TODO
- Add API key to address throttling issues

## Stretch Goals
- Heroku
- Automatic feed refresh
